  # QueryResults are returned when doing a query
  # You can retrieve the values they contain either by the properties ID or by the query name.
  #
  # Since it is possible that a JOIN is being requested it is not guaranteed that either the query name or the object ID are unique.
  # If that's not the case then it is impossible to retrieve one of the two values. It is therefore important to choose unique queryNames
  #  Furthermore, it is not possible to guess which type a query is returning, and therefore it is also not possible to know whether a property is repeating or not, it is possible that a repeating property contains 0 or 1 values, in which case nil or that single value are returned. If multiple values are found for a property then an Array with those properties will be returned
